# CG-Assignment
The main aim of this Project is to illustrate the concepts of working on a Satellite Communication using OpenGL.
In this project we have used input devices like mouse and key board to interact with program and we have also used a small SolidCube to represent a data, which travels as data transfer from source to destination.
Here we implemented the working of the satellite communicating to the other devices trying to process information.
